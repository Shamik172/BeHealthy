        <p>
          Yoga finds its roots over 5,000 years ago in the Indus Valley civilization. Early references
          appear in the Rigveda, one of the oldest known scriptures. It was initially developed as a
          spiritual discipline, combining physical, mental, and spiritual practices.

          The word "Yoga" derives from the Sanskrit root "yuj," meaning "to yoke" or "to unite,"
          symbolizing the union of body, mind, and spirit.
